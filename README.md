# Tasker Permissions
 Utility to easily grant Tasker (and related apps) permissions

## Why This Exists
There are a lot of restrictions in Android regarding what a normal app can access. By granting Tasker a few permissions via [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) you open up a lot of new oportunities to customize your Android device!

Usually this process can be hard to go through so I created an app to make it easier for users! Now you only need to click a few buttons to allow the needed permissions!

## Use At Your Own Risk
ADB is a very powerful tool and can wreak havoc on your device if used improperly. This app is a simple UI wrapper to run some ADB commands on your device and won't run any commands that can harm your device. Please make sure to always download the official app from this page so that you are sure you're running the correct commands!
